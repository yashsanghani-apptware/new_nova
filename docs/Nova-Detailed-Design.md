# **Project Nova - Detailed Design Specification**


**Introduction:**

Project Nova is designed to transform the Agsiri platformâ€™s property listing management by implementing a robust, scalable, and secure Listing Service. This detailed design specification outlines the architecture, data models, API designs, workflows, and other key components necessary to realize the objectives outlined in the functional specifications.


# **1. System Architecture**

**1.1 High-Level Architecture:**

- **Microservices-Based Architecture:**
  - Project Nova will be built as a microservice, separate from but integrated with other Agsiri platform services.
  - Each component, such as Listing Management, Workflow Engine, and Event Logger, will function as independent, scalable services.
  
- **Service Interaction:**
  - The Listing Service will interact with external sources (Property Scouting Service, realtor platforms) via RESTful APIs.
  - Internal interactions will include the Farm Onboarding Service, Event Logging Service, and the Agsiri IAM system for authentication and authorization.

**1.2 Technology Stack:**

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js** for the core service logic.
  - **Express.js** for building RESTful APIs.
  - **MongoDB** as the primary data store for listings.
  - **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** for handling asynchronous events and workflows.
  - **Redis** for caching and session management.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React.js** for the user interface, including dashboards and listing management tools.
  - **Redux** for state management.

- **Security:**
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure API authentication.
  - **TLS/SSL** for encrypting data in transit.
  - **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** for encrypting sensitive data at rest.

**1.3 Deployment:**

- **Containerization:** 
  - Use **Docker** for containerizing the microservices.
  
- **Orchestration:**
  - Deploy on **Kubernetes (K8s)** for managing containers, ensuring scalability, and high availability.
  
- **CI/CD:**
  - Implement **Jenkins** or **GitLab CI** for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
  
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Utilize **Prometheus** for monitoring and **Grafana** for visualization.
  - Use **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for centralized logging and error tracking.

}
```

**2.2 Indexing:**

- **Unique Indexes:** Apply unique indexes on `listing_id` to prevent duplication.
- **Compound Indexes:** Use compound indexes on `status` and `listing_source` to optimize queries based on listing workflows.
- **Text Indexes:** Implement text indexes on fields like `name`, `property_description`, and `address` to enable efficient search functionality.

- ## Suggestion from @amolthite
  - **Pagination and Filtering:** We can Include details on pagination and filtering options for endpoints that return lists to improve performance and usability.

**3.2 Security:**

- **Authentication:** All endpoints will require JWT-based authentication.
- **Authorization:** RBAC will ensure that only users with appropriate roles can access or modify certain listings.
- **Input Validation:** Implement stringent input validation on all API endpoints to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common attacks.

# **4. Workflow Design**

**4.1 Listing Lifecycle Workflows:**

- **Workflow Stages:**
  1. **SOURCED:** Initial status when a property is sourced.
  2. **SCREENED:** After initial criteria are met.
  3. **IN REVIEW:** During the detailed analyst review phase.
  4. **REVIEWED:** After analyst review is complete.
  5

. **IN DUE DILIGENCE:** During the full due diligence process.
  6. **SELECTED:** Property passes due diligence.
  7. **REJECTED:** Property fails due diligence.
  8. **ARCHIVED:** Listing is no longer active but kept for historical purposes.

- **Status Transitions:**
  - Implement state machines to manage transitions between these statuses.
  - Each transition will trigger specific events that update the status and log the change.

**4.2 Automated Triggers:**

- **Screening Trigger:** Automatically trigger when a listing is sourced.
- **Review Trigger:** Manually triggered by an analyst after screening.
- **Due Diligence Trigger:** Automatically triggered after the review is complete.
